### What is the AWS Well-Architected Framework?
The AWS Well-Architected framework, helps to understand the pros and cons of decisions made users make while building systems on AWS. 
By Using framework users earn the best practices for architecture designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient and cost-effective systems in the cloud.
 
 Produces a way to consistently measure architecture against best practices and identify areas for improvement.
  
    The pillars of the AWS Well Architected Framework
  -   Operational excellence

The ability to support development and run workload effectively, gain insight into their operations, and to continuously improve supporting process and procedures to deliver business value

  -   Security

Protect data, systems, and assets to take advantage of cloud technologies
  -Reliability

Ability of a workload to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when itâ€™s expected.
  -   Performance Efficiency

Use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and maintain efficiency ad demand changes and technology evolves
  -   Cost Optimization

Ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point


### What are reliability and availability?
One of AWS Well-Architected Framework is a plan for failure also called workload downtime. 

Reliability is a measure of a system's ability to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when expected. This means the system is available for use and able to operate the workload through its lifecycle.

Availability is the period of time when a service is available, and the time required by a system to respond to a request made by a user. 
Availability (also known as service availability) is a commonly used metric to quantitatively measure reliability. Availability is defined as the percentage of time that a workload is available for use. Available for use means that it performs its agreed function when required.

      Availability = "Available for Use Time" / "Total Time"


      Fault Tolerance: built in redundancy of a system or application so it can remain operational

      Scalability: ability to accommodate increase or decrease in capacity usage without changing the design

      Recoverability: process, policies, and procedures related to restoring a system after system failure
 
### What are some AWS architecture tools?

##### AWS WA Tool helps you throughout the product lifecycle by:

-Assisting with documenting the decisions that you make

-Providing recommendations for improving your workload based on best practices

-Guiding you in making your workloads more reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective
